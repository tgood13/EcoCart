# EcoCart
A project created during HackUCI 2020

EcoCart is an app that allows users to get C02 emission estimations resulting from the groceries they purchase.

## Inspiration

Given our current trajectory, I think it is important for people to be conscious of their contribution to factors that negatively affect the planet. I wanted to create an App that helps empower consumers to make more environmentally friendly and informed decisions.

## What it does

EcoCart provides C02 emission estimates given a quantity of grocery inputs from the user using data taken from a 2011 study which performed full life cycle assessments of an assortment of 20 grocery food items.  

## How I built it

I used Xcode to develop a mobile application using the Swift programming language.

## Challenges I ran into

There were times where the screen was completely blank when I was trying to make a collection view or a table view. This was problematic because there were no error messages, just blank screens. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

There were many points where I was was annoyed of the same error and I'm proud of myself for figuring these out and not giving up when things got difficult.

## What I learned

I became much more comfortable working with mobile development for iOS. Specifically, I learned how to make collection views, table views, and how to navigate between various view controllers.

## What's next for EcoCart

After having completed EcoCart, I can't see there being any additions until more data is available. Calculating greenhouse gas emissions associated with a product is a difficult task, and so there isn't much information about this out there. As we accumulate data on these things, however, the opportunities for apps to provide quick access to data will be endless.
